# archive-ocr-realtime
Very simple prototype that does OCR (with annotation) on real-time camera feed from android 

## Background
This prototype is very simple and was created back in late-2018 as proof-of-concept for the project [Chameleon](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zdQa7_9QbrFcsNzgxBMQ7Sv3g_zm-tcT/view?usp=sharing). This repo is created in mid-2020 more as an archive of our work since the project has long been ceased. It is hence been tidied up by updating Android frameworks and libraries to that of 2020.
